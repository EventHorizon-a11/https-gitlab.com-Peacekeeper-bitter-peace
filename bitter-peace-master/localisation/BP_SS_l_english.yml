Thus, the 2nd SS infantry brigade received two Latvian "Schuma" battalions in the autumn of 1941, and four more until may 1943, before being renamed the Latvian SS volunteer brigade on 18 may 1943.\n \nAfter successfully forming and assigning Army group North in November 1943, the division entered the battle of Novosokolniki in the Pskov region to stop the Soviet winter offensive. Despite persistent resistance, the Latvians were unable to stop the Red Army's advance. In July 1944, Soviet troops entered Latvia and occupied Riga on October 13, 1944.

In may 1945, it surrendered to the Allied forces in Schwerin."
